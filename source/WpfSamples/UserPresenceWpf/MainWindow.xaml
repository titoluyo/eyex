    <!-- This WPF sample shows how an image source can be changed depending on whether
         the user is present or not. The EyeX Engine will consider the user to be present 
         if at least one of the user's eyes can be tracked. Under normal usage, the user
         will be considered present if he or she looks at the computer screen (which has 
         the eye tracker device attached to it), and not present if he or she looks away
         from the computer screen. -->
